Some conventions to follow when wokring on this project:

Naming:
GizzyBase is the initial contract deployed on the 17th June. After that, every update has to be named
in this format: GizzyUpdate<number><name>. For example: GizzyUpdate1Auction.sol, GizzyUpdate2Breeding.sol etc.

Versioning and Upgrading workflow:
the master branch contains the repo that has been deployed and it has the build folder in it.
when working on an update, create a new branch, rename the build folder, start working. this is
done because build folder contains info on when and where the contract has been deployed. we need
this info for production but not while in dev environment. so in the separate branch, developer 
can freely delete the build file without worrying about info about production env getting lost.

[IMPORTANT] Updating Contracts:
a newer logic contract should inherit the latest logic contract. a migration file should be written 
for the new logic contract

Deployment:
run migration file for the new logic contract. then change the implementation address on the 
proxy contract

deploy the 1st and 2nd migration. change the variable inside the 3rd migration to 2nd's address.
change ownership to superuser and initiate the logic contract (which will set self as admin)

ROLES:
1. Owner - controls the proxy contract
2. Admin - main owner of the logic contract
3. Accountant - handles money stuff
4. Server - handles stuff that requires some level of automation
